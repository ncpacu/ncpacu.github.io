# Purpose of the organization

This organization helps NCPA students to have a wider outlook for scholarship competitions. Comprehensive competition experience is an integral part of students' profiles, which is exactly what selective universities and colleges are looking for. For another, participating in competitions can help prepare students for college since academic competitions motivates them to better understand some of the complex topics in their field of interest, which can potentially enhance their class performance (GPA) at school. As a matter of fact, compared to outstanding performances in athletic competitions that the school organizes for sports teams each year, NCPA lacks formal organizations of academic competitions. To fill the space of potential improvement in this aspect, this organization will provide students a way to better understand themselves, develop further in subject information and research, and finally support themselves to have higher performances in the application of undergraduate programs.

## Benefits for NCPA

NCPA values students' ability to negotiate, collaborate, plan, and achieve. Academic competitions fit these purposes perfectly. When students are given the opportunities demonstrate these abilities through the means of academic competitions, they get recognised and can be proud of ourselves; their achievements, furthermore, can promote the student body's academic enthusiasm when shout outs are given in school assemblies. As NPCA students, we strive to become better selves, and those honors and achievements could serve as a way to prove our work and ambitions. This is what NCU is born for. We need to give students opportunities to reach their goals, and in turn we need to show our achievements and honors to these pre-NCPA students and parents the Pulao Prouds! We have many competitors schools, whose students excel at academic competitions, so if NCPA students don't even know about the existence of those academics competitions, they will miss the shot of joining in the community of academic competitors around China. Also, competitions definitely help students' personal growth. This will help them to have higher performance in college application and hence increase NCPA’s reputation among International High Schools, which will also help to gain high parent acceptance as college application is one of most important reasons why parents decide to send their children to NPCA.

## Benefits for NCPA Students

Academic competition experiences is one of most important backgrounds of students' profiles that top universities and colleges are looking for. Participating in competition gives students better opportunities to have a more colorful high school experience; this includes their aspiration to take challenges, the every step that they take towards their goals, the perseverance they demonstrate when facing difficulties, and much more. The achievements of those competitions reflect the spirits of students' hard work and commitment. In addition, competitions motivate students in academic research (e.g. Public Forum Debates), real-world problem solving (e.g. Girl Technovation, China Thinks Big), gaining deeper understandings of AP courses (e.g. International Economics Olympiad, Physics Bowl, Canadian Chemistry Contest, etc.), and the exploration of their personal interests (e.g. International Linguistics Olympiad).
