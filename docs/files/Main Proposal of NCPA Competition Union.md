# Purpose of the organization

This organization helps NCPA students to have a wider perspective of scholarship competitions. Comprehensive competition experience is one of the most important parts in students' profiles, which is exactly what selective universities and colleges are looking for. For another, participating in competitions can help students get more prepared for college since this process will help them have a deeper comprehension of those fields and also potentially enhance their class performance (GPA) at school. As a matter of fact, compared to outstanding performances in athletic competitions that the school organizes for sports teams each year, NCPA now lacks formal organizations of competitions in academic fields. To fill the space of potential improvement in this aspect, this organization will provide students a way to know better about themselves, develop further in subject information and research, and finally support themselves to have higher performances in the application of undergraduate programs.

## Benefits for School

NCPA's main propose for students are navigation, collaboration, planning and achievements. Academic Competitions are perfectly fit to those requirements. During each assembly, we hope our students can be proud of ourselves. This is why we promote student's honor, call out students. We want honor, we want students to achieve, so we need to give student opportunities to reach that. We need to show pre-NCPA students and parents the pulao proud! We have many competitors, if we don't compete, Pulaos will miss the shot of taking part in conversation of competition with other schools students. Also, achievements definitely help student's personal growth, which help them to have higher performance in colleges application. Those better performance helps NCPA have higher rank in International High School ranking, which is researched and made by pre-secondary students, parents and those companies.

## Benefits for Students

Academic competition experience is one of most important backgrounds of students' profile which top universities and colleges are looking for. Participating in competition gives students better opportunities to have colorful experiences their school life: their growth in every step of the competition, how to face the failure etc. The achievements of those competition describe the spirits of student's hard working and challenging overcoming.  In addition, competitions motivate students in academic research, solving problems in society (e.g. Girl Technovation, China Thinks Big), having deeper comprehension in APs learning (e.g. International Economics Olympiad, Physics Bowl etc.)
